# Pondering Paths
## home sweet home
used the following video -----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gexu9M7p5aU&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge as a reference because I did not know how to pass arguments. watching that video I then learnt how to do it and what is the specific command for it.
## The Commands Used and the Result Obtained:
/challenge/run ~/e
Writing the file to /home/hacker/e!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{YbsFjzwQfHRfh4uEvnKHKcpkThX.dNzM4QDL5AjN0czW}
using the video I got to know how what is the specific command to pass an argument and then obtained the flag for the module.
