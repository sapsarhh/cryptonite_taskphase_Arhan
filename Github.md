# Basics of Github
To establish a connection between my github repository and the Ubuntu Terminal, I typed the following command on my ubuntu terminal ----> git clone https://github.com/sapsarhh/cryptonite_taskphase_Arhan.git .
This created a folder on my WSL system which now lets me access my folder(cryptonite_taskphase_Arhan) on the ubuntu terminal through the cd command which opens the specified folder.
