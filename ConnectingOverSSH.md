# Getting Started
## Connecting Over SSH
Learnt how to link SSH on my system with pwn.college. Got started by pasting the ssh-keygen -f key -N '' command on the terminal on Ubuntu, which generated two files namely key and key.pub.
Then I used a command cat key.pub which basically reads the file key.pub and displays the contents of the said file. Copied the content of the file and pasted it onto the website under the settings tab(inside the SSH KEY) which helped me link website pwn and the linux terminal.
