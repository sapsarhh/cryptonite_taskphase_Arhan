# Pondering Paths
## Program and Absolute Paths
As the name of the module suggests, I learnt about the absolute paths of a specific file inside a directory, like how a subfolder can be created inside a specific folder and that folder can be referred to as /folder/newfolder just to give an example.
As the challenge said I just had to invoke a file 'run' which was inside another file 'challenge' and the said file was invoked using the command------> /challenge/run which did nothing but invoked the run file whilst reffering to its absolute path which was inside challenge and the first / refers to the root directory.
## Code and the Output recieved: 
/challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:

Reffered to following video explaining the difference between a relative path and an absolute path: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ephId3mYu9o&ab_channel=Udacity
