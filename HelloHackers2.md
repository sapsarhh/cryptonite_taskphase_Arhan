# Hello Hackers
## Intro To Arguments
Firstly learn what are arguments and commands, in the sense that command is the first word in the sentence which is written onto the terminal whilst an argument is the data which is written after the command.
Learnt the use of the echo command, what echo does it basically returns or echoes the argument(words written after it), for example i write echo Hello World inside my terminal and press enter, the terminal would simply return me the words Hello World. Watched this hilarious yet informative video on the echo command -----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ySzMHxMjw&ab_channel=LearnLinuxTV
After watching the video I went back to the module and simply typed hello hackers on the linux terminal which gave me the flag.
~~~
bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
