# Linux Luminarium(Hello Hackers)
## Intro To Commands
After getting done with the "Getting Started" Dojo, I started doing the "Linux Luminarium" Dojo in which the first module is Intro To Commands. Used the following link through the Lectures and Reading tab and learnt some basics related to the bash command-line:
https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Main_Page . Then following this I started the Intro to Commands module and tried out the 'whoami' command which returns or displays the username(hacker in this case) to the terminal.
After this, I tried the hello command which basically returned me the flag which I used to complete the module successfully.
~~~
bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:

hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$

## Intro To Arguments
Firstly learn what are arguments and commands, in the sense that command is the first word in the sentence which is written onto the terminal whilst an argument is the data which is written after the command.
Learnt the use of the echo command, what echo does it basically returns or echoes the argument(words written after it), for example i write echo Hello World inside my terminal and press enter, the terminal would simply return me the words Hello World. Watched this hilarious yet informative video on the echo command -----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ySzMHxMjw&ab_channel=LearnLinuxTV
After watching the video I went back to the module and simply typed hello hackers on the linux terminal which gave me the flag.
~~~
bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
