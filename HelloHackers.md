# Linux Luminarium(Hello Hackers)
## Intro To Commands
After getting done with the "Getting Started" Dojo, I started doing the "Linux Luminarium" Dojo in which the first module is Intro To Commands. Used the following link through the Lectures and Reading tab and learnt some basics related to the bash command-line:
https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Main_Page . Then following this I started the Intro to Commands module and tried out the 'whoami' command which returns or displays the username(hacker in this case) to the terminal.
After this, I tried the hello command which basically returned me the flag which I used to complete the module successfully.
~~~
bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{o_7U5896qUOI3OdSuDSZ2Amng6_.ddjNyUDL5AjN0czW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$
