# Getting Started(Using The Dojo)
## Lectures and Reading
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJO1A2neZ6Y&ab_channel=pwn.college, watched the following video to get started with pwn college, WSL and SSH in general.
The aforesaid video helped me with getting started with the website and gave me the basic knowledge on what flags are.
Learnt how to start a specific task by basically pressing the start button and linking it with the terminal by typing the link ssh -i ./key hacker@dojo.pwn.college
on the terminal, getting the flag and submit that specific flag for the task.
