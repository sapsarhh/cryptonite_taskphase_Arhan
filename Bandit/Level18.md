# Level 18
Now when I try to login to level 18, it logs me out and so I read the website and it tells me that .bashrc has been modified and so I cant login.
so that is when I invoke the man ssh command to try and get more info on how to login with some different options and maybe do something different.
and reading the manual page of ssh i got to know -t argument can be used to force a pseudo-terminal allocation which it might not log mt out of.
