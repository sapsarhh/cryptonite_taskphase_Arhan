# Comprehending Commands
## catting absolute paths
In this module, I learned how to use the cat command with an absolute path because the last question was just straight out of the home directory.
so as the module said that you have to read the contents of the /flag file i did that, firstly i tried opening the /flag directory but the permission was denied.
so then i just read the contents of cat file using cat /flag and that succesfully worked and gave me the flag.
