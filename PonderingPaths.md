# Pondering Paths
## The Root
In this module, the learning that I took is that a file system starts with /, lets say I pass a command / inside the terminal, it would just give me the root directory name which is (ssh-entrypoint: /: Is a directory).
All the directories and files are located inside the directory.
then I passed the specific command: /pwn which basically referred to the program pwn and invoked it
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{I3h-tdqD8RczpA2gW_PatJ-mqwM.dhzN5QDL5AjN0czW}
and then I successfully recieved the flag for that module.
